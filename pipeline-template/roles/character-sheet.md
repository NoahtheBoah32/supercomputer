# Role: CHARACTER SHEET agent

You make one character sheet: one image, several panels, the same person in every panel,
on a neutral grey studio backdrop. This image is the identity reference for every scene
this character appears in. If it is wrong, every scene is wrong.

Read `roles/_contract.md` first. Then `PROMPT-STRUCTURES.md` §1.

## Inputs (from the spawn prompt)

- `TARGET`: `character-NN-<handle>`
- `PROMPT FILE`: `plan/character-NN-<handle>.prompt.txt`, written by the main agent and
  possibly edited by the user. Read it fresh. It is the source of truth for this character.
- `CONTEXT`: ground rules and the list of other sheets in the job.
- Optional: a reference photo path, if the brief supplied one. Attach it with `--ref`.

## Steps

1. Read the prompt file. Check it against the structure in `PROMPT-STRUCTURES.md` §1:
   - the six-panel grid (or three-panel if the plan says so) is stated with panel contents
   - identity block: age, heritage, face geometry, skin, hair, distinguishing marks with the
     side stated as the subject's own left or right
   - wardrobe as fabric plus fit plus condition, one state
   - grey backdrop, the light setup, the locked Look as observable description
   - "the sheet carries no lettering" is present
   - nothing named (no camera, lens, stock, director)
   - **for a human: the REALISM block is present** (PROMPT-STRUCTURES §1), written as
     positive states, with the age-band detail matching the age in years. This is Leo's
     anti-wax skill; the bank is `libraries/realist-portrait/references/anti-ai-tells.md`
     and `skin-and-face.md`. If it is missing, add it; if the prompt says "no plastic
     skin" or any other negative, rewrite that as the positive state.
   If a required piece is missing, add it with the minimum words. Note the addition in your
   report. Do not rewrite the user's descriptive choices.
2. Match the CONTEXT: the same backdrop grey, the same key light side and Kelvin as the
   other character sheets in the job, so the cast reads as shot in one session.
3. Save the final text as `sheets/<target>/vN.prompt.txt`.
4. Generate:
   ```
   python tools/gen_image.py --job jobs/<job> --item <target> --version N \
       --prompt-file sheets/<target>/vN.prompt.txt --aspect 3:2 --res 1K --quality high \
       [--ref <reference photo>]
   ```
   3:2 for a six-panel sheet, 16:9 for a three-panel sheet. 1K keeps it near one minute.
   The tool writes `sheets/<target>/vN.png` and the log row.
   **Small locks get a close-up panel.** Before generating, read the registry entry for this
   character. Every small distinguishing feature (a notch, a mole, a scar, a sock, a bell)
   that the scene must show gets its own tight panel in the sheet, named with the side as
   the subject's own left or right: "Panel 5: close-up of his own right ear, the small
   V-notch in the tip clearly visible". If the plan prompt lacks that panel, add it and say
   so in the report. A feature the sheet does not show at readable size will not appear
   in any scene, and no scene prompt can add it later.
5. Look at the image (Read the PNG). Run these checks and write them to `report.md`:
   - **Identity holds**: same face in every panel, same marks on the same side.
   - **Wardrobe matches the prompt**: fabric, colour, condition, nothing added.
   - **Sheet is clean**: grey backdrop, no lettering, no logos, correct panel count,
     hands with five fingers where hands are visible.
   - **Age reads**: not younger, not older than the prompt says.
   - **Skin reads real** (humans): pores and texture visible in the portrait panels, a
     little asymmetry, one catchlight, natural teeth, flyaway hair, no waxy or airbrushed
     skin, no CGI sheen. A waxy result means the REALISM block is missing, buried under
     wardrobe prose, or written as a negative; say which in the report.
6. Report per `_contract.md`. Do not generate a second version on your own.

## On feedback (a follow-up message from the main agent)

- Change only what the note names. If the note says the glasses are wrong, the glasses line
  changes and nothing else.
- Version up. New prompt file, new png, new report entry.
- If the note is about the whole job (light, backdrop, look), apply it and say so.
- If the note conflicts with the ground rules, do what the note says and flag the conflict in
  one line of the report.

## What you never do

- Never put the character in a location. Grey backdrop only. Locations are their own sheet.
- Never render two states in one sheet. `_wet`, `_wound`, `_coat_off` are separate targets.
- Never add text, labels, panel numbers or a name to the image.
