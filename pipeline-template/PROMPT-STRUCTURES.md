# PROMPT-STRUCTURES.md — the shape of every prompt this pipeline writes

Distilled from the AI Production kit in `libraries/` (Seedance Feature Pipeline Phase 0–9,
Seedance Prompt Architecture, the Higgsfield formats, the Prompt Archive, the realist
portrait skill, and the worked example). Read the library file when a structure here is
not enough. Never work from memory when the library is one file away.

Three rules apply to every prompt below (the kit's three bans, adapted):

1. **No names in prompt text.** No director, film, DP, camera body, lens model, film stock.
   Decide the look with the libraries; write it as something you can see. The translation
   table is in `libraries/Seedance-Feature-Pipeline.md` §BAN 1.
2. **No character-count trimming on Seedance.** Budget by block necessity. Kling keeps the
   1500-character combined cap because that is where it fails.
3. **GPT Image 2 has no negative field.** Every exclusion is written as a positive state.

Handles: `@doctor` in the plan and the card. In a prompt that attaches references, the
handle becomes "Image 1 is the doctor" (GPT Image 2) or stays `@doctor` (Seedance, where
the workspace has an elements panel; if it does not, write the name in words).

## 1. Character sheet (GPT Image 2 · 3:2 six-panel, or 16:9 three-panel · 1K high)

Source: `libraries/realist-portrait/SKILL.md` Mode C and its `references/` (Leo's anti-wax
skill: `anti-ai-tells.md`, `skin-and-face.md`, `wardrobe-hair-grooming.md`),
`libraries/Prompt-Archive/character-sheet.md` #12,
`libraries/worked-example/canvas/characters/@nia/prompt.md`.

One prose block. Order matters. Every line is load-bearing.

```
Character reference sheet of one [woman/man], photographed in a single continuous studio
session, laid out as a [3:2 sheet of six panels in a 3-wide by 2-tall grid | 16:9 sheet of
three panels side by side] separated by thin clean gaps; the sheet carries no lettering.
The same individual in every panel, consistent facial identity across all frames:

[IDENTITY]  a [age]-year-old [woman/man] of [concrete heritage], [skin tone with undertone],
[age markers: lines, creases, texture]; [face geometry: shape, nose, eyes, brows, chin,
lips]; [distinguishing marks, each with "her own left / his own right"]; [hair: colour,
texture, cut, flyaways]; [build]; [facial hair or makeup].

[REALISM, human characters only]  Natural skin texture with visible pores, fine vellus
hair catching the light, faint uneven tone and a little surface shine on the forehead,
nose and chin, no digital smoothing; soft subsurface warmth where light passes through
the ears, nostrils and lip edges; natural facial asymmetry, one eye a little smaller,
brows at slightly different heights; [the age-band detail from skin-and-face.md §3, e.g.
"faint expression lines at the outer eyes, natural under-eye tone variation"]; eyes with
visible iris fibre, a darker limbal ring, natural moisture in the inner corner and one
catchlight only; natural teeth, not uniformly white; hair with a few flyaways and a
slightly uneven hairline; fine even film grain in the midtones and shadows.

[WARDROBE, one state]  [garment: fabric, fit, condition] over [garment], [trousers],
[shoes], [carried item on which shoulder or hand]. Fabric reads real: [one wear detail].

[PANELS]  Panel 1: head and shoulders, front, neutral relaxed expression, eyes to lens.
Panel 2: head and shoulders, three-quarter left, [a small expression]. Panel 3: full body
front, arms relaxed, hands open and fully visible. Panel 4: full body back view. [Panel 5
and 6: the same in wardrobe B, only if the plan says the sheet carries two wardrobes.]

[CAMERA AS DESCRIPTION]  Camera at eye height for the portrait panels, chest height for the
full-body panels, 29-degree field of view, focus on the near eye in the portrait panels.

[BACKDROP + LIGHT]  Seamless mid-grey studio backdrop with a soft floor-to-wall falloff and
a faint scuff near the floor line. Large soft key from camera-left, gentle fill, 4:1
key-to-fill ratio, one soft catchlight at ten o'clock, neutral 5200K white balance.

[LOOK]  [the locked Look as observable description, e.g. "Warm colour-negative film
character: soft warm highlights that roll off gently, fine even grain in the midtones and
shadows, forgiving mid-contrast, slightly lifted blacks."]
```

Rules:
- **The anti-wax rule.** GPT Image 2 renders human skin waxy, airbrushed and symmetrical
  by default, and every scene inherits the sheet. So every human sheet carries the
  REALISM block, and it is written as positive states only: there is no negative field,
  and "no plastic skin" summons plastic skin. Pull the phrasing from
  `libraries/realist-portrait/references/anti-ai-tells.md` (the positive-side column of
  the table) and `skin-and-face.md` (§1 texture, §2 asymmetry, §3 age band, §5 eyes).
  Pick one or two marks, not five. Animals and objects skip the block; the same idea for
  them is "fur with individual guard hairs", "paint with brush marks and dust".
- Grey. Grey tested better than white or black for video reference.
- Face view plus full-body front and back in one generation, so the model never guesses.
- One state per sheet. `_wet`, `_wound`, `_coat_off` are separate sheets.
- Family or relational likeness is stated feature by feature, never "looks like her son".
- Name the side as the subject's own left or right, so a mole does not swap panels.

## 2. Environment sheet (GPT Image 2 · job aspect · 1K high)

Source: `libraries/worked-example/canvas/locations/@loc_apartment/prompt.md`, the P-02
location plate template in the kit's presentation, `libraries/Prompt-Archive/location-env.md` #19.

```
Wide three-quarter-angle photograph of an empty [place], taken from [the inner corner |
the doorway | the far end] looking diagonally toward [the main wall or feature], camera at
[standing | seated] eye height, camera about 45 degrees to the main wall so two walls and
the floor plane read clearly, [84 | 63]-degree field of view.

[ANCHORS]  [One or two anchor objects, exact, placed left or right from the camera: "a green
enamel pendant lamp over the bench, camera-right", "the double slipway doors, camera-left".]

[LAYERS]  Foreground: [surface, material, one worn detail]. Midground: [furniture or
structures, materials, finish]. Background: [walls, openings, what is seen through them].

[LIGHT]  [Source] from [side], [quality], [Kelvin] white balance, [shadow character].
[Air: dust, haze in %, still or moving.]

[PALETTE]  [60/30/10 line with hex from the ground rules, as material plus light:
"cream plaster #F3E3C3 warmed by the window light, honey-oak floor, one red accent
#B8322A on the water tower through the glass".]

The room is empty: no people, no animals. The place carries no readable lettering or brand
marks. [LOOK as observable description.]
```

Rules:
- Three-quarter, never frontal. Frontal plates break more often when animated.
- Anchor objects make the place read as the same place from every later angle.
- Empty. The scene still adds the people.

---

## 3. Element sheet (GPT Image 2 · 1:1 · 1K high)

Source: the P-02 prop template, `libraries/Prompt-Archive/element-product.md` #1 (light
element), `libraries/worked-example/canvas/props/`.

Prop or product:

```
Photorealistic three-quarter overhead product shot of [the object] on a neutral grey
concrete surface, soft directional lighting from camera-left, isolated subject, nothing
else in frame. [Size in cm]. [Materials, one by one]. [Wear and condition]. [Colour as
material plus light, hex where locked]. Plain unbranded surfaces, blank matte finish where
a label would be. [LOOK as observable description.]
```

Light element or VFX element:

```
Isolated light element, studio asset, floating alone on a flat seamless matte black field:
no environment, no ground, no horizon, pure black behind the light. [Strand count and
material: "many fine red #E4002B filaments braided into one coherent rope"]. [Core: "a
dense smooth white-hot core near the centre"]. [Ends: "looser separated strands studded
with sparse white-hot beads trailing toward each end"]. [Path: "one gentle wave-like bend,
not a tight S"]. No visible source object, vehicle or emitter: pure self-luminous light.
Sharp edges against black, suitable for compositing. Red and white are the only colours
present.
```

Rules:
- Unbranded on the sheet even if the brief names a brand. Name it in words in the scene.
- Name the object in words in every later prompt too; the model drops small detail that
  exists only in the image.

---

## 4. Scene storyboard (GPT Image 2 · 3:2 · 1K high · up to 10 references · client sign-off only)

Source: `libraries/worked-example/shots/SHOT-001/storyboard.md` (the whole prompt),
`libraries/Prompt-Archive/element-product.md` #2 and #3 (role-scoped references).

The storyboard is a grid of keyframes, one per beat on the card, in time order. The client
signs the scene off on it. **It is never attached to the video model.** It shows one
camera angle and it drags the clip toward that one image; Leo tested it and the clip got
worse. The clip is made from the prompt plus the sheets (§6).

```
A storyboard sheet of [n] photographic keyframes from one continuous moment of a short
live-action film, laid out as a [2 x 2] grid on a [3:2] landscape canvas. Each panel is a
[job aspect] frame with a thin warm-cream border and even gutters; the panels read
top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right, in time order. The sheet carries no
lettering, numbers, captions or labels anywhere[; the only legible character is ...].

REFERENCES
Image 1 is [character]. It controls [face, hair, marks, wardrobe]. Ignore [its grey backdrop
and panel layout].
Image 2 is [environment]. It controls [the room, the anchors, the light direction]. Ignore
[its emptiness].
Image 3 is [element]. It controls [the object's identity and size]. Ignore [its surface].

PANELS
Top-left — [beat 1 as one instant: shot size, camera position relative to an anchor, who
is where, which third, facing which way, gaze, hands. Left and right from the camera.]
Top-right — [beat 2 ...]
Bottom-left — [beat 3 ...]
Bottom-right — [beat 4, the arrival state ...]

LIGHT
[Restate the environment sheet's light: source, side, Kelvin, shadow character.]

STYLE
Photoreal live-action film stills. [LOOK as observable description.] All panels share the
same camera position logic, the same light and the same characters. [Palette hex as
material plus light.] [The forbidden list as positive states.] Exactly [n] people.
[Identity locks per person, sides stated.]
```

Rules:
- One panel per beat, never more panels than the card has beats. Four is the usual.
- Attach only the handles in this scene's tag set. A cluttered set is less coherent than
  a small chosen one.
- Role-scope each attachment: what it controls and what to ignore, or the model inherits
  the grey backdrop and the panel gutters.
- 1K. Nobody but the client and the user reads it, and it feeds nothing.

## 5. The scene card (main agent writes; internal; never sent to a model)

Source: `libraries/Seedance-Feature-Pipeline.md` Phase 3, `libraries/director-dp.md`,
`libraries/worked-example/shots/SHOT-001/card.md`. The ACTING lines come from
`libraries/Skills/ACTING SKILL.md` (§2, §3, §5.2, §5.3, Part III). Method names and tension
numbers stay on the card, like every named pick.

AUDIO             [ambience bed, foreground foley]. No music.
```

FOV table (degrees only in prompts; the mm column is for choosing):

| FOV | ≈ mm | Use |
|---|---|---|
| 180° | fisheye | POV, dream state |
| 107° | 14–16 | huge interiors, epic establish |
| 84° | 20–24 | establish, group blocking |
| 63° | 28–35 | observation, reportage |
| 47° | 40–50 | neutral human perspective |
| 29° | 75–85 | dialogue bust, medium isolate |

| 12° | 180–200 | hands, objects, detail |
| 8° | 300–400 | extreme compression |

"23°" rounds to 18° or 29°. Never an off-table value.

## 6. Video prompt

### 6.1 Seedance 2.5 (sealed prompt; the approved sheets attached as references; no frames)

Source: `libraries/Seedance-Prompt-Architecture.md` (§2 block order, §5 optics, §8 rules,
§10 pre-flight), `libraries/worked-example/shots/SHOT-001/prompt.md`,
`libraries/Sources/higgsfield-seedance-clean-SKILL.md`,
`libraries/P-04-Sealed-Prompt-Anatomy.md` (Leo's seventeen blocks in order, the fixed-shape
reference line, and the SHOT 014 worked example), and
`libraries/Skills/CINEDANCE HIGGSFIELD SKILL.md` ("Active references", "Character
description rule", the 4-D method).

**What is attached.** The approved sheets the shot needs, and nothing else. No start
frame, no end frame, no storyboard: Leo tested them and the clip gets worse. The video
director decides which sheets by walking the card's tag set with the CINEDANCE rule (a
reference is attached only if the thing must be visible or required in this exact shot)
and writes the result to `video.refs.txt`, one handle and one path per line, attach order,
strongest first. ACTIVE REFERENCES in the prompt lists exactly those handles, in the
CINEDANCE form, minimum anchors, "100% matches the reference". The sheet is the source of
truth for face, body, wardrobe and texture; long prose overwrites it.

Because no frame is attached, FIRST FRAME / BLOCKING states the opening state as
positions (so the first frame is occupied and nobody arrives late) and the last ACTION
beat states the arrival state the same way.

**How the handles reach the model.** The clip is rendered by `tools/gen_video.py` through
PiAPI, where Seedance names its references `@image1`, `@image2`, ... in attach order. Write
the prompt with the pipeline's own handles (`@doctor`, `@clinic`); the tool rewrites each
one to its `@imageN` from `video.refs.txt` when it sends, and saves the sent text as
`video-vN.prompt.txt`. Nine references at most per task, and the prompt at most 4 000
characters.

**Continuity between clips (Leo's answer, 2026-09-23).** A continuing scene carries the
same reference set as the scene before it, cooler included, plus anything new; its FIRST
FRAME / BLOCKING is the previous clip's `ARRIVAL OBSERVED` restated; and the carried
states are repeated in POSITIVE LOCKS, the block where the anatomy says continuity lives.
If a sequence falls apart between shots, tighten FIRST FRAME / BLOCKING, not the action.

Block order. Use only the blocks the scene needs. Opens on SCENE CONTEXT, never a style
header. CAMERA third among the core layers.

```
SCENE CONTEXT
[Time, place, who, what happens across the clip, in three sentences.]

ACTIVE REFERENCES
@doctor: [age + role/build + current state + unique visible features + action-critical
details + voice if he speaks]. 100% matches the reference.
@clinic: controls the room, the window on camera-left and the light direction.
@xray_film: [size, what is on it].

LOCATION MAP
Foreground: [...]. Midground: [...]. Background: [...]. The camera is [where] at [height].
[Light] enters from [side].

FIRST FRAME / BLOCKING
[The opening state from the card as positions: who is where, which third, facing which
way, distance in metres, gaze, hands. Left and right from the camera. The first visible
frame is occupied by these people in these places; nobody arrives late.]

FORMAT MODE
One continuous shot; the camera does not cut on its own.    (or the timed multishot form
with FOV per segment and "no drift mid-segment")

OPTICS
[Shot size], [FOV]-degree field of view throughout, rectilinear, no drift in field of view.
[Focus layering.]

CAMERA
[Position relative to an anchor, height, side of the subject]. [The move as an observed
result with a speed in km/h or a distance in metres over the full duration, or "static,
locked"]. No shake. [Tonal character as description.]

ACTION
Camera: [the move above, continuous from 0.0 s to 6.0 s].
0.0–2.0 s — [beat, measured]. Subtext: [what the character really wants here].
2.0–4.0 s — [beat]. Subtext: [...].
4.0–6.0 s — [beat]. [The arrival state from the card, as positions.] Subtext: [...].

(With an approved previz the ACTION block is written second by second instead, one line per
second of the clip, each line stating what the camera does in that second as read from the
previz frames, then the beat; the prompt's opening line names the length, fps and aspect:
"[8]-second clip, [24] fps, [16:9]." See `roles/video-director.md`, "With a previz".)

PERFORMANCE
Performance: [one register line for the whole clip, e.g. "restrained and understated;
shifting gaze, visible rise and fall of breath, small facial movements, no broad gestures"].
@doctor [one paragraph: the master profile rewritten for this scene, scaled to the frame,
with an eye task. Muscle movement, not emotion labels: "jaw tight, eyes fixed on the film,
a slow blink".]
Locks: [this scene's likely collapse, as positive states: "tears welling but not falling";
"only @old_lady speaks; the others keep their lips closed".]

PHYSICS
[What cloth, hair, dust, liquids, light do; masses have weight.]

LIGHTING
[Source, side, quality, Kelvin, exposure set for whom, how much brighter the window is.]

AUDIO
[Ambience bed with timed foley.] Between [a] s and [b] s @old_lady speaks exactly [n]
words, clearly, in English: "[line]". Then no more speech. No music, no score, no
narration, no other voices.       (or: The clip is silent by design apart from [ambience];
no speech at all.)

STYLE
Photoreal live-action. [LOOK as observable description.] No readable text or logos
anywhere, no subtitles, [palette exclusions from the ground rules].

OUTPUT SETTINGS
[aspect], [resolution], 24 fps, real-time throughout, [n] seconds.

POSITIVE LOCKS
Exactly [n] people. [Identity locks per person, sides stated.] [Rigid elements stay rigid.]
[Screen direction.] [The forbidden list as positive states.] [Continuing scene: the states
carried from the previous clip, restated: "the cooler lid is already open a hand's width
from the first frame", "the sash stays up a hand's width throughout".]
```

Pre-flight before saving (from the architecture file §10):
blocks in order · tags only for present objects · no style prefix at the top · everything
positive except STYLE and AUDIO exclusions · speeds in km/h, atmosphere in % and metres ·
emotion as muscle movement · left/right from the camera · FOV in degrees from the table ·
CAMERA third · white balance in Kelvin · colour as material plus light · dialogue word
count stated as a lock · no banned name anywhere · no block cut to hit a number · every
@tag in ACTIVE REFERENCES has a line in `video.refs.txt` and every line there has a tag ·
no still, end frame or storyboard in the attachment list.

### 6.2 Kling (positive + negative, ≤ 1500 characters combined)

Source: `libraries/Prompt-Archive/video-single.md`, the reference-image pipeline's Stage 4.

```
[Camera move as a result the viewer sees, with pace]. [Lead motion, measured]. [Supporting
motion]. [Ambient motion]. [Rigid elements stay rigid: "the walls, desk and window stay
rigid and unwarped, parallax only"]. [Light and palette in one line, hex]. [Look in one
line]. [aspect]. No legible text, logos or signage.

Negative: [only what this shot tends to get wrong: "camera cutting on its own, extra
people, warped hands, lettering resolving on the film, whole-frame red cast, CGI look"]
```

The same `video.refs.txt` sheets are attached. Camera-led shots go to Seedance.
Element-led shots are where Kling earns a run.
