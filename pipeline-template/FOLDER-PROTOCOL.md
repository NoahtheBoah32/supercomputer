# FOLDER-PROTOCOL.md — where everything goes and what it is called

The job folder is the passing table. Subagents never hand files to each other; they write
to a fixed place under a fixed name, and whoever needs the file reads it from there. A
combiner never has to guess what a file is, because the name says so.

## The job folder

`jobs/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>/`, made by `python tools/new_job.py <slug>`.

## Naming law

`<type>-<NN>-<handle>` for sheets. `scene-<NN>` for scenes. `<what>-v<N>` for versions.
`<what>-approved` for the one the user picked.

- `type` is one of `character`, `environment`, `element`.
- `NN` is two digits, assigned in the plan, never reused inside a job.
- `handle` is the `@handle` without the `@`: lowercase, underscores, no spaces.
- A state change is its own sheet: `character-03-old_lady_wet`, not a note on 02.
- Versions count up and are never overwritten. A reroll is `v2`, not a new `v1`.
- `approved` files are copies. Deleting `v3.png` never loses the approved image.

## Who writes where

| Path | Written by | Read by |
|---|---|---|
| `brief.md`, `ground-rules.md`, `plan/*`, `STATUS.md` | main agent (the user edits `plan/*`) | everyone |
| `sheets/<target>/*` except `approved.png` | that sheet's subagent | main agent, scene agent |
| `sheets/<target>/approved.png` | main agent | scene agent |
| `scenes/scene-NN/card.md` | main agent | scene agent, video director |
| `scenes/scene-NN/still*`, `end*`, `report.md` | scene agent (except `*-approved`) | main agent, video director, next scene agent |
| `scenes/scene-NN/video*` | video director (except `video-approved.mp4`) | main agent |
| `*-approved.*` | main agent only | everyone |
| `log.csv` | every agent appends one row per run | main agent |

A subagent that writes outside its own target folder is broken. It should stop and report.

## STATUS.md

The main agent's board. Plain markdown table, rewritten after every gate:

```
# STATUS · 2026-09-22-clinic

| Item | State | Version | Rerolls | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ground-rules | OKAY | | | |
| plan | OKAY | | | |
| character-01-doctor | APPROVED | v2 | 1 | glasses fixed |
| character-02-old_lady | GATE | v1 | 0 | waiting on user |
| environment-01-clinic | APPROVED | v1 | 0 | |
| element-01-xray_film | RUNNING | | 0 | |
| scene-01 still | — | | | blocked: character-02 not approved |
| scene-01 end | — | | | |
| scene-01 video | — | | | |
| video-settings | OKAY | | | Seedance 2.5 · 16:9 · 6 s · 1080p |
```

States: `—` (not started) · `PLANNED` · `RUNNING` · `GATE` · `APPROVED` · `BLOCKED` ·
`SKIPPED (user override)`.

## log.csv

Header, written by `new_job.py`. One row per generation, appended by whichever agent ran it.

```
run,date,time,item,version,model,prompt_file,refs,settings,output,status,seconds,note,credits,gen_id
1,2026-09-22,14:03:10,character-01-doctor,v1,gpt-image-2,sheets/character-01-doctor/v1.prompt.txt,,3:2 1K high,sheets/character-01-doctor/v1.png,completed,61,,320,dDypIHDmmP9K1un0gODC
```

Run #1 is logged whatever happened to it. A failed run is a row too.

`credits` is what the run cost: `gen_image.py` reads the account counter before and after;
`gen_video.py` writes PiAPI's usage figure there and the dollar estimate (`piapi ~$4.80`)
in the note, which the tally (`tools/credits.py`) adds up on its own "dollars" line.
`gen_id` is the generation id (ElevenLabs) or the PiAPI task id. The tally
decides kept versus thrown away by comparing each run's output with the approved file
byte for byte, so never edit an approved copy by hand.
